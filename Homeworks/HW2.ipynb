    "You've been hired as the manager of Sacred Heart Medical Clinic (SHMC). As part of its business model, SHMC usually employs doctors on demand, meaning that doctors are asked to come only when there are appointments. However, once a doctor has been asked to come, SHMC must pay him or her regardless of whether the patient shows up or not. You want to use data on previous appointments to predict which patients are going to attend, so that you can plan better how many doctors to call."
